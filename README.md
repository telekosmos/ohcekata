# ehco 

Simple solution in [go](http://golang.org) to https://kata-log.rocks/ohce-kata.

## Build

Clone this repo to your `go` workspace. If you don't know what is this, setup your go development environment by following the [instructions](https://golang.org/doc/code.html)

Then:
`go get "github.com/c-bata/go-prompt"`
`go build`

This last command will produce an executable file named `ohcekata`. Just run the file by

`./ohcekata`

and _enjoy_

## Test
Simply after _build_ the app, run in the same directory:

`go test`
