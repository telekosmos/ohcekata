# ehco 

Simple solution in [go](http://golang.org) to https://kata-log.rocks/ohce-kata.

## Build

Clone this repo to your `go` workspace. If you don't know what is this, set up your `go` development environment by following the [instructions](https://golang.org/doc/code.html).

Then:

`go get "github.com/c-bata/go-prompt"`

`go build`

This last command will produce an executable file named `ohcekata`. Just run the file by typing

`./ohcekata`

and _enjoy_ :grimacing:

## Test
Simply after _build_ the app, run in the same directory:

`go test`
